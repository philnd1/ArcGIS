# Step Four: Saving your spreadsheet as .csv file

## Saving as a CSV

When you are finished inputting your data, you must save your excel file as a CSV.

**You will need to use the desktop version of Excel (Office 365) in order to save your file as a CSV.**

If you are using your web broswer to edit your Excel file, first save a copy to your computer. Open your file with the desktop version of Excel and follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to "File: Save a copy".
2. Choose a location to save your file. Make sure you know where you are saving the file so you can access it in order to upload it to the mapping program.
3. Under "save as type", make sure you select "CSV UTC-8 Comma Delimited"
4. Choose an easy to remember file name. This file name will also be the display name for your data layer in the mapping software.
