Consider these elements when adding mapping data:
* You choose what places to map based on your close reading of the text
* Avoid mapping the same place multiple times, as points on the map will cluster and be difficult to click
* Provide a description of the point being mapped in Spanish, in the "Context esp" column
* Utilize the provided drop down menu choices for these columns: "Exactness", "Real or Fictional", "Category", and "Structure Type". Hover over the column for more information about those choices:
